# Better Black Hole

## What does it look like?
As we all know, the current way of displaying your Black Hole date is with a colored emote. This can be particularly demotivating when you see it moving from green... to orange... to red...

When you install this browser extension, all user profiles will be populated a better way of displaying the Black Hole date.

## Other functionality
The new way of displaying also comes with a clickable "Show" / "Hide" link, that will (temporarily) show the emote again.
